# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The project was built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX in order to develop front-end web development skills. Responsive design was also implemented, which allows the app to be used in mobile (< 768px), tablet (768 - 1024px), and desktop (> 1024px) screen sizes.
